(1)If the dynamic memory is not deallocated then there are chances of memory leak(a difficult task to handle).
   The disadvantages of memory leak are :
  (i) The availability of space becomes less.
  (ii)Performance is affected.

(2)New dynamic memory needs to be allocated for an increased size of existing array because memory has been already allocated for the current size and that memory is 
   fixed.If we want to allocate new memory we just acnnot increase that by one,instead we need to deallocate it first and then re-allocate memory for that.

(3)The memory researved for an array is only the memory for an array so it does not make a difference id that memory is deallocated or not.

(4)The concept implmented in the fourth question is of function oeverloading.So,the compiler gets to know by the number of arguments which function to call.

(5)The most important of all things was the usage of dynamic memory.Also I used the concept of function overloading in the workshop.Also I learnt why it is necessary to   de-allocate memory.

(1)What are the two main categories of fundamental types?
Answer: The two categories are:
        (i) Floating point type
        (ii) Integer type

(2)What are compound types?
Answer: Types composed of other types are called compound types.

        Examples are : (i) Structs (ii) Classes

(3)What is shadowing?
Answer: Shadowing means hiding the global value assigned via a local value declaration.
Example:
          #include <iostream>
 using namespace std;

 int main() {
     int i = 6;
     cout << i << endl;
     for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
         int i = j * j;
         cout << i << endl;
     }
     cout << i << endl;
 }


THE OUTPUT OF THE FOLLOWING CODE IS

   6
   0
   1
   4

   6
EXPLANATION-The first line output is 6 which makes sense but From the next line the output does not turn out same as it would be thought because value of "i" gets 
changed from 6 to (j*j)i.e. shadowing took place.

(4)What is a refrence?
Answer: An alias of an object or an variable is called a refrence.

(5)If there is an integer called "X", Write the code to ctreate refrence to this integer(X) called R;
Answer: int R;
        int &R=X;

(6)Having a type called "Employee",Write the code to dynamically create an instance of an Employee.
Answer: int n; 
        Employee* employee=nullptr;
        employee=new employee[n];


(7)Delete the dynamic Employee created in question 6.
Answer: delete[] employee;
